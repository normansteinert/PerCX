PerCX is a simple permafrost carbon response model. The carbon response to climate in PerCX is determined by the sum of the CO2 and CH4 responses. For more details see Steinert and Sanderson 2025 ([https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2025-1714](https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-16-1711-2025))

PerCX is currently calibrated to AR6 Chapter 5 estimates of the permafrost carbon-climate feedback to temperature. The calibration is done with CMIP6 SSP2-4.5 surface temperature (tas) data, which is provided within the <code>/input</code> directory.

Within the <code>scripts/</code> directory, <code>PerCX_demo_stabilization.ipynb</code> shows an example use case for a 3Â°C stabilization scenario.
